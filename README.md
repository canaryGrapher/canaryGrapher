# Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px">
## I am Yash Aryan
I like designing websites, discussing ideas, and meeting new people bundled with a deep passion for building things from scratch. I have an immense craze for DIYs, fiction, country music, and movies. Everyday, I am learning new things and am open to new ideas and will hop onboard new projects if I lifind it interesting. I'm always full of ideas, so you'll always find me working on something or the other.
